  <p>
    <strong>MIND OVER MATTER</strong> is the full-length debut album by Dayon,
    self-released on January 17, 2025 across all streaming platforms. Spanning
    33 tracks and running 1 hour and 23 minutes, the project blends experimental
    rap, emo rap, trap, boom bap, and R&B into a cohesive, emotionally raw body
    of work.
  </p>

  <p>
    The concept of the album revolves around perseverance and mental strength.
    Throughout the tracklist, Dayon confronts stress, overthinking, anger,
    depression, and deeply personal struggles. Much of the album was created
    during one of the most difficult periods of his life: facing a one-year jail
    sentence for assault, dealing with the loss of all his previous Dayonikin
    accounts, and navigating turbulent relationship challenges.
  </p>

  <p>
    Under his producer alias Dayonikin, he self-produced key tracks including
    “Can’t Be Your Friend,” “One Way,” “I Know,” “Burdens,” “Laptop,” and “Amen.”
    Additional production contributions come from DWNLD, Rollie, cgkbeatz,
    and others, alongside notable collaborations with Lil Keel and long-time
    collaborator SJ (HXS SJ).
  </p>

  <p>
    The release marks a major identity shift — transitioning from Dayonikin
    to Dayon as his official performing name — symbolizing a restart after
    reclaiming his artistic path.

  <p>
    <strong>A LIVING NIGHTMARE</strong> is a collaborative full-length album by
    Dayon and producer AVI Christian, released on February 1, 2025 through
    HXS Music Official. The 12-track project runs approximately 33 minutes and
    blends hip-hop and rap with atmospheric, emotionally charged production.
  </p>

  <p>
    The album explores themes of fear, regret, self-doubt, and mental entrapment.
    AVI Christian’s cinematic and haunting production creates a dream-like yet
    unsettling environment, allowing Dayon’s vulnerability to sit at the
    forefront.
  </p>

  <p>
    Though concise, the project delivers a powerful narrative arc and represents
    a continued evolution toward cohesive, conceptual storytelling.
